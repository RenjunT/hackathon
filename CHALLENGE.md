## Short Description
Fragmented data-sharing practices between public offices, NGOs, and service providers lead to delays, duplication of efforts, and resource misallocation. This challenge focuses on developing a secure and interoperable data-sharing system tailored for multi-actor collaboration during refugee crises. The goal is to ensure real-time, privacy-compliant exchange of essential information, such as refugee registration data, available services, and resource distribution, enabling better coordination and faster decision-making.

---

## Technical Requirements
- **Access Control Mechanisms**: Implement role-based permissions to define who can access, modify, or share data.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Enable live data synchronization across stakeholders.
- **Audit Trails**: Include traceable logs of all data access and modifications for transparency.
- **Scalability**: Ensure adaptability to varying data volumes and stakeholders.

---

## Pain Points

### Refugees
- **Immediate Needs**: Require rapid access to essential services (e.g., housing, healthcare) but expect data privacy and security during registration and service access.
- **Trust Gap**: Skepticism or fear around how personal data is handled and shared among different actors.
- **Fragmented Experience**: Inconsistent service quality due to differences in municipal and cantonal processes.

### Municipalities (Gemeinden)
- **Autonomy and Responsibility**: Operate independently but lack standardized digital tools to securely exchange data with cantons, NGOs, and federal agencies.
- **Resource Limitations**: Lack technical capacity and expertise to implement secure data-sharing infrastructure locally.
- **Communication Gaps**: Often rely on manual processes (e.g., Excel sheets, emails) to communicate with other stakeholders, leading to errors and delays.

### Cantonal Administration
- **Accountability**: Bears responsibility for refugee safety and well-being, requiring accurate and up-to-date data from various actors.
- **Infrastructure Gaps**: Lack of centralized digital infrastructure to securely interact with NGOs and municipalities in real-time.
- **Bureaucratic Overhead**: Slow decision-making processes hinder timely implementation of technical solutions.

### NGOs and Service Providers
- **Diverse Data Requirements**: NGOs often collect and process refugee data for specific purposes (e.g., housing, food aid), but lack clarity on what data can be shared and how.
- **Data Privacy Compliance**: Struggle to meet strict Swiss data privacy standards (e.g., storage locations, encryption).
- **Inconsistent Processes**: Different cantonal requirements and fragmented communication channels create bottlenecks in data exchange.
- **Role Ambiguity**: NGOs often fill gaps left by public services but lack the mandate or authority to standardize data-sharing practices.

---

## Used Sources
- **Mock Refugee Datasets**: Simulated anonymized data for development and testing.
- **Data Privacy Standards**: GDPR-compliant frameworks for handling sensitive data.

---

## Target Situation / Scenarios
A municipality office, a refugee support NGO, and a healthcare service provider need to share real-time refugee registration data, medical resource availability, and accommodation status. The proposed system will enable these actors to safely exchange live updates, prevent duplicate services, and respond efficiently to emerging needs.

---

## Benefits
- **Faster Coordination**: Real-time updates reduce delays in service delivery.
- **Informed Decisions**: Stakeholders access accurate, up-to-date data for resource planning.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Audit trails ensure accountability.
- **Scalable Framework**: Adaptable to varying crisis scenarios and organizational structures.
